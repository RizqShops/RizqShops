Extend Google Workspace apps with add-ons.
You can develop add-ons with Apps Script or your preferred hosting infrastructure, development tool chain, source control system, coding language, and code libraries.
Build with Apps Script
Anyone can use Apps Script to create powerful extensions in a web-based, low-code environment.
Build in any runtime
As an alternative to Apps Script, you can build an add-on in any coding language you want, as long as you can return properly formatted JSON for the interface to render as cards.
