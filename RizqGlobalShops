All other site content
Unless otherwise noted, the documentation on this site, including any code shown in it, is made available to you under the Apache 2.0 license, the preferred license for all parts of the of the Android Open Source Project.

Apache 2.0 is a commercial and open-source-friendly software license. The majority of the Android platform and documentation is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. While the project strives to adhere to the preferred license, there may be exceptions, such as for documentation (code comments) extracted from a source code module that is licensed under GPLv2 or other license. In those cases, the license covering the source code module will apply to the documentation extracted from it. Source code modules that are used in the generation of documentation and have licenses that require attribution can be found in the Documentation Licences section below.

Third-party components of this site such as JavaScript libraries are included in the Android Open Source Project under the licenses specified by their authors. For information about these licenses, refer to the source files in the Android Open Source Project.

All other content on this site, except the license documents themselves and as otherwise noted, is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license.

You may use the content of this site in any way that is consistent with the specific license that applies to the content, as described above. For content licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 2.5, we ask that you give proper attribution.

Terms of Use
We are pleased to license the Android documentation and sample code under terms that encourage you to take, modify, reuse, re-purpose, and remix the content as you see fit. Except as noted in the Restrictions section below, you are free to use the documentation content in your own creations. For example, you could quote the text in a book, cut-and-paste sections to your blog, record it as an audiobook for the visually impaired, or even translate it.

Restrictions
While the documentation itself is available to you under the Apache 2.0 or other licenses noted, proprietary trademarks and brand features are not included in that license.
Google's trademarks and other brand features (including the Android stylized typeface logo) are not included in the license. Please see Brand Guidelines for information about this usage.

The use of sample source code provided in the SDK or shown in this documentation is subject to the conditions detailed in the Apache 2.0 license.
Attribution
Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content that appears on a page made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license.
